##  Problem Statement

Egyptian farmers face growing challenges such as unpredictable crop diseases, inefficient irrigation, and overuse of pesticides — all caused by limited access to **real-time agricultural data**.  
These issues lead to:
- Decreased crop yield and productivity.  
- Financial losses due to excessive resource use.  
- Environmental stress from over-irrigation and chemical waste.  

This directly threatens Egypt’s **food security** and undermines the UN **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** related to clean water, responsible consumption, and climate action.

## 💡 Our Solution

**AgriTech AI** is an autonomous, AI-powered decision-support platform for farmers and policymakers.  
It delivers **real-time, bilingual (Arabic/English)** recommendations through a simple dashboard and an AI chatbot, enabling data-driven, climate-smart farming.

### 🌱 Core Features
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Predicts crop diseases, irrigation timing, and pesticide use.  
- **IoT Integration:** Collects soil data (moisture, salinity, temperature) from sensors.  
- **Smart Chatbot:** Farmers can ask “When should I irrigate?” and receive clear, data-backed answers.  
- **Dual Interface:** Arabic + English accessibility for local farmers and policymakers.  
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Displays analytics and visual insights on soil and crop health.

## 🧠 Core Technology

AgriTech AI integrates two main layers:

### 1. Data Collection & Analytics
IoT sensors gather **soil and environmental data** in real time.  
This data is processed via a secure analytics pipeline to generate meaningful agricultural insights.

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction Engine
Trained ML models predict irrigation needs, detect anomalies, and estimate potential crop disease outbreaks.  
Each new data cycle refines the model for higher **accuracy, adaptability, and autonomy**.

### 🧩 Planned Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Programming Language | Python |
| ML Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib |
| Database | SQL (planned) |
| Visualization | Power BI / Tableau |
| Design | Figma |
| Cloud Deployment | Azure / AWS (future) |
